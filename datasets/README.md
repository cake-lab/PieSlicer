## Dataset details

Both of our datasets were generated by a script (see `../src/generateFlickr/`).
This script works by searching for a random word selected from a word list and processing the first 1000 images from this search.

Each of the two datasets below have different criteria upon which we select images.
Note, we also include _image-6k_ which combines both _image-1k_ and _image-5k_ into a single dataset.

### Image-5k Dataset

The _image-5k_ dataset selects every image until it has 5000 total images, downloading the original size of each one.
These images have a wide size distribution, but tend to be heavily skewed towards smaller images.


### Image-1k Dataset

The image-1k dataset is design to have data sizes evenly distributed across a range from 0KB to 10MB.
To do this we divided our range into buckets of 100KB in size each containing 10 images.
For each image if it was of a size of an unfilled bucket we selected it, and if not we moved on to the next image.
